# 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

## 0-memset.c 
* a function that fills memory with a constant byte.

## 1-memcpy.c 
* a function that copies memory area.
  FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: memcpy. Run man memcpy to learn more.

## 2-strchr.c
* a function that locates a character in a string.
  FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strchr. Run man strchr to learn more.

## 3-strspn.c
* a function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
  FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strspn. Run man strspn to learn more.

## 4-strpbrk.c
* a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
  FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strpbrk. Run man strpbrk to learn more.

## 5-strstr.c
* a function that locates a substring.
  FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strstr. Run man strstr to learn more.

## 7-print_chessboard.c
* a function that prints the chessboard.

## 8-print_diagsums.c
* a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.

## 19-set_string.c
* a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.

## 101-crackme_password
*  a file that contains the password for the crackme2 executable. Hint: ltrace, ldd, gdb and objdump can help.
You may need to install the openssl library to run the crackme2 program: sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
